### Surfaces:
Many different kinds of Blocks (bricks, grass, concrete etc.) -
Two Categories:

- Rough Surfaces where the spider can climb.
- Slippery Surfaces where the spider cannot get a hold of itself. => not climbable

=> Slippery might also affect the movement of the spider (releasing the key wont stop it immediately)

Those Spots determine if the spider is able to shoot a web at the Platform. (==> Web Mechanics)

### Enemy/Danger Encounter:
Two Categories:

- static:
  - Pits (Spider falls into certain demise - f.e. spikes or end of level)
  - Deadly Platforms/Statonary Actors (thermal dangers like fire)
  
- dynamic:
  - small bugs (no danger - only food)
  - defeatably enemies (predators trying to eat the spider but it is also able to prevail)
  - impossible foes (Huge enemies, Situational Dangers -> Woman throwing newspaper at the spider)
