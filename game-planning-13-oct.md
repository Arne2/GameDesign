# Plans for our Game

## Possible mechanics

### Webs

- Swinging
- Hooking onto surfaces with your web
- Hookable and non-hookable surfaces
- Pulling yourself up by your web
- Ability to construct web bridges
- Maximum length for your web (range)
- Pursuit: slow down enemy with webs
- Web will be shot from the spiders face/body
- Web doesn't consume resources if it fails to connect
- Web trampoline
- Shoot a blob of web

You will be able to shoot a blob of web, that is connected to your spider by a string. The further you shoot the web, the more resources are needed. 
When the blob hits a hookable surface it will stick to it. You can then pull yourself up by your web or lower yourself down.
You can also stick your end of the web on the ground, creating a web-bridge or web-trampoline.
When the blob doesn't hit a proper surface in its range, you will pull back the web and regain the resourcess invested.

When eating bugs you will gain resources needed to shoot your web. This resource could also be used as a sort of highscore. 
The more you collected (being thorough), and the less you used (being efficient), the higher your score is.
