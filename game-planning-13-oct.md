# Plans for our Game

## Possible mechanics

### Webs

- Swinging
- Hooking onto surfaces with your web
- Hookable and non-hookable surfaces
- Pulling yourself up by your web
- Ability to construct web bridges
- Maximum length for your web (range)
- Pursuit: slow down enemy with webs
- Web will be shot from the spiders face/body
- Web doesn't consume resources if it fails to connect
- Web trampoline
- Shoot a blob of web

You will be able to shoot a blob of web, that is connected to your spider by a string. The further you shoot the web, the more resources are needed. 
When the blob hits a hookable surface it will stick to it. You can then pull yourself up by your web or lower yourself down.
You can also stick your end of the web on the ground, creating a web-bridge or web-trampoline.
When the blob doesn't hit a proper surface in its range, you will pull back the web and regain the resourcess invested.

When eating bugs you will gain resources needed to shoot your web. This resource could also be used as a sort of highscore. 
The more you collected (being thorough), and the less you used (being efficient), the higher your score is.

### Surfaces:
Many different kinds of Blocks (bricks, grass, concrete etc.) -
Two Categories:

- Rough Surfaces where the spider can climb.
- Slippery Surfaces where the spider cannot get a hold of itself. => not climbable

=> Slippery might also affect the movement of the spider (releasing the key wont stop it immediately)

Those Spots determine if the spider is able to shoot a web at the Platform. (==> Web Mechanics)

### Enemy/Danger Encounter:
Two Categories:

- static:
  - Pits (Spider falls into certain demise - f.e. spikes or end of level)
  - Deadly Platforms/Statonary Actors (thermal dangers like fire)
  
- dynamic:
  - small bugs (no danger - only food)
  - defeatably enemies (predators trying to eat the spider but it is also able to prevail)
  - impossible foes (Huge enemies, Situational Dangers -> Woman throwing newspaper at the spider)

### Resources:
The spider is able to collect fuel for itÂ´s web shooting by eating bugs and obtaining Collectables.


### Other Mechanics
- Horizontal and/or vertical levels
- Gravity
- Animations (just a few frames)
- Leaves, that break when walked over
- Jumping

## Upcoming in the first prototype:
